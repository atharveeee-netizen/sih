### 1. Acoustic Frequencies & Swarm Pre-Warning
- **Research Finding**: Ferrari et al. (2008) and Bencsik et al. (2011) demonstrate that *Apis mellifera* acoustic emissions shift during pre-swarming preparation: energy in the $100 - 200\text{ Hz}$ fanning band surges into the $300 - 400\text{ Hz}$ band 24 to 48 hours before swarm takeoff, accompanied by queen piping pulses at $320 - 450\text{ Hz}$.
- **Engineering Implication**: An embedded acoustic sensing system must achieve frequency resolution finer than $10\text{ Hz}$ across the $100 - 500\text{ Hz}$ band, with high sidelobe suppression to prevent fanning leakage from triggering false pre-swarm warnings.
- **BEEVIL Design Decision**: Sample at $f_s = 2000\text{ Hz}$, apply a 256-point Hanning window, and execute a 256-point real FFT yielding $\Delta f = 7.8125\text{ Hz}$ resolution per bin. Partition bins into 4 dedicated sub-bands: Fanning (100-180 Hz, $k=13..23$), Waggle (200-280 Hz, $k=26..36$), Pre-Swarm (300-400 Hz, $k=38..51$), and Distress (450-750 Hz, $k=58..96$).

  - References: [TI TPS62840 Datasheet](../references/HARDWARE_DATASHEETS.md), [Nordic nRF52840 Product Spec](../references/HARDWARE_DATASHEETS.md)
  - System Implementation: 5-minute duty cycle with 2.0 uA deep-sleep current, achieving 18+ months of battery life.
  - Firmware: [`firmware/beevil_rak4631_transmitter/beevil_rak4631_transmitter.ino`](../../firmware/beevil_rak4631_transmitter/beevil_rak4631_transmitter.ino) (FreeRTOS low-power tickless idle) brood nest at $34.5^\circ\text{C} \pm 1.5^\circ\text{C}$ to ensure proper pupal wing development. Temperature drops below $32.0^\circ\text{C}$ cause high larval mortality and morphological wing deformities; sustained elevation above $36.5^\circ\text{C}$ causes heat stupor.
- **Engineering Implication**: Temperature sensors must have sub-tenth-degree absolute accuracy ($\pm0.1^\circ\text{C}$) and NIST traceability, placed directly along the central brood frame face without conducting hive outer wall temperature gradients into the reading.
- **BEEVIL Design Decision**: Deploy a 5-point sensor probe utilizing Texas Instruments TMP117 NIST-traceable digital RTDs ($\pm0.1^\circ\text{C}$ across $-20^\circ\text{C}$ to $+50^\circ\text{C}$, 16-bit resolution $0.0078^\circ\text{C}$) routed on ultra-thin flexible PCB ribbon clamped to Frame 4.

### 3. Sequential Change-Point Detection for Slow Biological Drift
- **Research Finding**: Page (1954) and Basseville & Nikiforov (1993) establish that cumulative sum (CUSUM) change-point sequential testing detects subtle mean shifts embedded in noisy physiological time series significantly faster and with lower false-alarm rates than static upper/lower threshold alarms.
- **Engineering Implication**: Slow brood chilling from declining worker population or queen failure ($0.02^\circ\text{C}/\text{hr}$ drift) is masked by sensor noise ($\sigma = 0.15^\circ\text{C}$) and will not cross coarse $\pm2^\circ\text{C}$ static threshold alarms until larvae have suffered irreversible chill shock.
- **BEEVIL Design Decision**: Implement an on-gateway recursive CUSUM drift filter calculating $S_t^+ = \max(0, S_{t-1}^+ + (y_t - \mu_0) - k)$ and $S_t^- = \max(0, S_{t-1}^- - (y_t - \mu_0) - k)$ with allowance $k = 0.5\sigma$ and decision threshold $h = 4.5\sigma$.

### 4. RF Propagation Through Stratified Hive Dielectric Media
- **Research Finding**: Nelson (1992) and ITU-R P.833-9 document dielectric properties of agro-biological media: pine wood exhibits $\epsilon_r' = 2.2, \tan\delta = 0.04$; high-moisture honey/comb exhibits $\epsilon_r' = 4.5, \tan\delta = 0.12$; and dense biological bee clusters exhibit $\epsilon_r' \approx 35.0, \tan\delta \approx 0.35$. Foliage attenuation in dense forest clutter introduces approximately $0.18\text{ dB/m}$ at $865\text{ MHz}$.
- **Engineering Implication**: Inside-hive transceivers must overcome approximately $8.7\text{ dB}$ of stratified hive attenuation before reaching free space. At $2.4\text{ GHz}$ (Wi-Fi/BLE), path loss and comb water absorption severely limit range to $< 15\text{ m}$. Sub-GHz frequencies ($865\text{ MHz}$) achieve vastly superior dielectric penetration and propagation through forest canopy.
- **BEEVIL Design Decision**: Standardize radio link on the $865.0 - 867.0\text{ MHz}$ IN865 ISM band (Semtech SX1262 LoRa engine, $+14\text{ dBm}$ Tx power, $-132\text{ dBm}$ sensitivity @ SF10, 125 kHz BW), external low-loss collinear gateway antenna, and regenerative multi-hop mesh routing.

### 5. Multi-Year Field Autonomy via Duty-Cycled Energy Management
- **Research Finding**: Roundy, Steingart, et al. (2004) and Raghunathan et al. (2005) demonstrate that agricultural IoT sensors in temperate/sub-tropical climates can achieve multi-year continuous operation only if active duty cycles remain below $0.5\%$, with deep-sleep current restricted to $< 5.0\,\mu\text{A}$.
- **Engineering Implication**: In-hive nodes cannot maintain continuous radio or acoustic listening without depleting typical lithium batteries in under 14 days. Energy harvesting and aggressive deep sleep are strictly required.
- **BEEVIL Design Decision**: Structure firmware into a 300-second (5-minute) periodic duty cycle: $289.45\text{s}$ in System ON deep sleep ($2.0\,\mu\text{A}$), $0.15\text{s}$ sensor read ($2.5\text{ mA}$), $10.0\text{s}$ acoustic acquisition ($3.2\text{ mA}$), $0.05\text{s}$ FFT execution ($8.5\text{ mA}$), and $0.35\text{s}$ LoRa transmission ($38\text{ mA}$). Total energy per cycle is $3.0\text{ mJ}$ ($0.85\text{ mWh/day}$), supported by a $1200\text{ mAh}$ LiFePO4 cell and $0.5\text{W}$ monocrystalline solar MPPT charger.
