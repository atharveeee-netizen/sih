## Full Remediation Log

### 🔴 CRITICAL-001: Missing Auth on Batch Mutations → ✅ RESOLVED

- `getSession(req)` + RBAC enforced on `PUT /api/batches/[id]`

### 🔴 CRITICAL-002: Unauthenticated Batch Minting → ✅ RESOLVED

- `getSession(req)` + `FIELD_OFFICER || ADMIN` required on `POST /api/batches`

### 🟠 HIGH-001: Privilege Escalation via Registration → ✅ RESOLVED

- `role` hardcoded to `FIELD_OFFICER`, never accepted from request body

### 🟠 HIGH-002: Guest Auth Bypass (IS_VERCEL) → ✅ RESOLVED

- All `IS_VERCEL` bypass blocks removed from auth routes

### 🟠 HIGH-003: OTP Leakage in API Responses → ✅ RESOLVED

- `devOtp` / `demoOtp` stripped from all response payloads

### 🟠 HIGH-004: Phone Number Overwrite → ✅ RESOLVED

- Verification tied to authenticated session via `getSession(req)`

### 🟡 MEDIUM-001: Missing Auth on DBT Disbursement → ✅ RESOLVED

- `getSession(req)` enforced on `POST /api/dbt/disburse`

### 🟡 MEDIUM-002: PostCSS / Next.js CVEs → ✅ RESOLVED

- Upgraded Next.js 14.2 → 16.3.4 (fixes 21+ CVEs)
- Fixed async `cookies()` breaking change in `dashboard/page.tsx`

### 🟡 MEDIUM-003: Unprotected AI Retrain Endpoint → ✅ RESOLVED

- `X-Lab-Auth-Key` + ECDSA signature validation added

### 🟢 LOW-001: No Rate Limiting on Auth → ✅ RESOLVED

- In-memory sliding-window rate limiter (10 attempts/min/IP)

### 🔵 INFO-001: Default JWT Fallback Secret → ✅ RESOLVED

- Hardcoded fallback removed from `auth.ts` and `middleware.ts`
- App throws `FATAL` error at startup if `JWT_SECRET` is unset

### 📦 DEPENDENCY CVEs → ✅ ALL RESOLVED

- `next`: 14.2.35 → 16.3.4 (21 CVEs patched)
- `nodemailer`: upgraded to 9.1.0 (1 CVE patched)
- `deepmerge-ts`: forced to 8.0.2 via npm overrides (1 CVE patched)
- `postcss`: resolved via Next.js upgrade (4 CVEs patched)
- `glob` / `eslint-config-next`: resolved via upgrade (1 CVE patched)
